# Learn Anything

Will be a proper tool for thought with global network attached.

Previous attempt can be seen at [learn-anything.xyz](https://learn-anything.xyz) and will be replaced as soon as we have first good build out.

Global data alongside user data will be preserved.

Global data will move into the new database and user data will be loaded on demand but currently LA doesn't have that many active users so it's not a concern. Focus is on making incredible application. [Reflect](https://reflect.app) is our inspiration in many ways.

## Setup

Install [task](https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation). Then run `task setup` & follow instructions until it says `✔️ you are setup`.

## Commands

Run `task` to see all possible commands.

## Dev

`task dev` will start web server, can then open `localhost:`.

## Contributing

You are welcome to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/bxtD8x6aNF) for discussions.

There is lots of work to do to build this into something incredible.

The focus is on the editor right now.
